# Employee_Turnover_Prediction

## What is Employee Turnover?
Employee Turnover or Employee Turnover ratio is the measurement of the total number of employees who leave an organization in a particular year. Employee Turnover Prediction means to predict whether an employee is going to leave the organization in the coming period.

A Company uses this predictive analysis to measure how many employees they will need if the potential employees will leave their organization. A company also uses this predictive analysis to make the workplace better for employees by understanding the core reasons for the high turnover ratio.

## Predicting the Employees Turnover:
This project features the implementation of an employee turnover analysis that is built using Pythonâ€™s Scikit-Learn library. In this project, I will use Logistic Regression and Random Forest Machine Learning algorithms. At the end of this project, you would be able to choose the best algorithm for your future projects like Employee Turnover Prediction.
